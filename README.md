Hello!!!

This is a Zillow widget I made using react. I'll give a breif description on how to get it started locally :D

To start with, you need to have npm installed on you're machine.

Once you've done that, you need to use your terminal to navigate to the app directory and type 'npm i' to 
install all dependencies. This part might take second depending on your internet speed. 

Now that you've done that. You can type 'npm run watch'. This will initiate a server without creating an entire build
on your machine. You can then navigate to localhost:8080 to check out the app.

Thanks for looking at it :D
